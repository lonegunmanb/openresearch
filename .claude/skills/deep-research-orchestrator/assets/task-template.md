# 1. Research Objectives & Constraints (Directives)

> Read-only section. Defined at plan approval, do not modify during research.

## Core Question

{{CORE_QUESTION}}

## Research Dimensions

| # | Dimension | Focus Areas |
|---|-----------|-------------|
{{DIMENSIONS_TABLE}}

## Constraints

| Constraint | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Time Scope | {{TIME_SCOPE}} |
| Geographic Scope | {{GEO_SCOPE}} |
| Language | {{LANGUAGE}} |
| Source Requirements | {{SOURCE_REQUIREMENTS}} |
| Exclusions | {{EXCLUSIONS}} |

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] Answer the core question comprehensively
- [ ] Include citations for all factual claims
- [ ] Address all research dimensions
- [ ] Acknowledge conflicting information explicitly
- [ ] State confidence levels and limitations

# 2. Execution Plan (DAG Scheduler)

> Dynamically updated. Root Agent dispatches sub-tasks based on this list.
> Format: `- [ ] [ID]: [Type]: [Description] (Status: [STATUS], DependsOn: [IDs])`
> Task Types: P* (Planning), E* (Execution: search+read), C* (Conflict resolution)

## Phase 1: Foundation

- [ ] P1: Planning: Intent Decomposition - Break down core question into sub-tasks (Status: PENDING, DependsOn: none)

## Phase 2: Execution (Search + Read)

{{DAG_EXECUTION_TASKS}}

## Phase 3: Conflict Resolution

{{DAG_CONFLICT_TASKS}}
